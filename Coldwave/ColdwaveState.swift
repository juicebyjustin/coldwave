/*
 âœ¨ Optional Enhancements You Might Consider:
     Move the AVPlayer handling into its own class (PlayerManager or similar), and expose playback state via bindings or @Published properties.
     Add playNext(), playPrevious(), or shuffle/repeat logic if you plan to grow this app.
     Implement persistence for user settings like coverSize or last played album/track.
