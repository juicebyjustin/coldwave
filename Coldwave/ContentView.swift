/*
 What's happening overall:
 This is your app's main view.
 It takes a ColdwaveState object (likely a @Published model class) and passes it to three subviews: SearchView, AlbumCoverView, and PlaybackControlView.
 It switches between showing a currently-playing album cover or a grid/list of albums depending on whether something is playing.
 Constants for image sizing and layout are declared globally for easy tweaking.
