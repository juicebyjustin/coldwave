 Key Points Covered in Comments:
 
 Purpose of the View:
    This view provides a user interface for searching content. It includes a search input field, a magnifying glass icon, and a clear button for resetting the search text.
 
 State Binding:
    The TextField is bound to the state.searchText, meaning that whenever the user types into the search field, the searchText property in ColdwaveState will be updated.
 
 Clear Button:
 T  he "X" icon is conditionally shown based on whether the searchText is empty. When tapped, it clears the search field.
 
 Styling:
    The search view has padding, uses secondary colors for text and icons, and features rounded corners for a modern look.
